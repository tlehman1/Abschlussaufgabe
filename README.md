With our 6th task we created a Server where you have access to a home, search, add and delete site. 
If you set up the server successfully you first come to the home page via "localhost:3000". Here you can see what to add to the home page URL to reach the three other sites.
When you go to "localhost:3000/search you can see all the points you current have in your databank.
When you go to "localhost:3000/add you can add data to your databank. If done successful you will pass onto the page "localhost:3000/add_notification". On this page there you can see the data you have added.
When you go to "localhost:3000/delete its the same like add but here you can delete the point by searching the name in the textfield and when done successful  you will pass onto the page "localhost:3000/delete_notification".
